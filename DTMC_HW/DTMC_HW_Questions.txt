Homework for Discrete Time Markov Chains (Chapter 4 in Sheldon Ross book)

For any problem that involves finding numerical steady-state values,
do _not_ do it by hand; instead, use Excel, R, or some other
similar tool. If the problem involves symbolic steady-state values,
then you may do it by hand.

None of these questions use any randomness like =RAND() unless noted.

These problem numbers refer to the 11th edition.

Some of the questions below are deliberately poorly phrased, since
that's life. It's up to you to adapt sensibly when needed.

Problem 4.29 Employee job classifications (this is pretty easy)
[4pts]
or, do this problem:
A molecule of water is hanging around the Great Lakes region,
consisting of the 5 lakes (M,S,H,E,O), or the air above the region
(which we'll call "A"), from which it might fall as rain or dew back
into a lake. Suppose it follows this transition matrix.
I'm leaving the time step size unspecified, since I'm making up
these numbers anyway.

M S H E O A
M .8 0 .1 0 0 .1
S 0 .98 .01 0 0 .01
H 0 0 .8 .15 0 .05
E 0 0 0 .7 .2 .1
O 0 0 0 0 .9 .1
A .1 .3 .3 .1 .1 .1

i) Explain what is good and what is not-so-good about this model.
ii) Now pretend the model is perfect as I specified it,
and find the relative amounts of water in each compartment.
iii) optional/project idea: make a more accurate model, and/or
adjust the transition probabilities.

Economic Quintile Problem

Use the graph at
http://people.emich.edu/aross15/coursepack3419/opportunity-1.png
to create a Markov Chain model of income mobility from one generation
to the next. The 1st quintile is the poorest, and the 5th is the richest.
a) What is the transition matrix? Figure out where each number goes.
There is a subtle issue here--what is it? Figure out what it is and
fix it in a reasonable way.
b) If you are in the 5th quintile, what is the probability that
your grandson will be in the 1st quintile?
c) What is the steady-state distribution? Compute it using methods
learned in class.
d) Explain the result you got in part (c).
e) Consider a person who is politically liberal/left-wing.
What would they want the transition matrix in part (a) to look like?
f) Consider a person who is politically conservative/right-wing.
What would they want the transition matrix in part (a) to look like?

Problem 4.33 Three types of exams (also not too bad)
[4 pts for matrix, 4 for solution]
or, do this problem:
A workplace has a sign that says something like "4 days accident-free".
Of course, the number of days is updated each day, either increasing
by 1 or jumping back to 0. Suppose an accident happens with probability
0.1 on any day, and each day is independent.
a) Is this a Markov chain? Explain why or why not.
b) If it is a Markov chain, formulate a Markov matrix for it.
Limit it to at most 9 days accident-free.
If it is not a Markov chain, find some way to simulate it, possibly
using =RAND() or similar functions.
c) Find the steady-state distribution, either numerically or by simulation.
d) Is the steady-state distribution similar to any common discrete distribution?
Explain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4.46 The Umbrella Problem
Hints: Does it work if your state is "# of umbrellas at home"?
What about "# of umbrellas at work"? Any other ideas?
Ultimately, your transition matrix will have a diagonal look to it,
but from lower-left to upper-right as opposed to the usual matrix
diagonal.
Once you have the matrix, finding the steady-state solution is
pretty much guess-and-check, and they give you the guess. You
should formally check it, though.
[4 for matrix, 4 for pi proof, 4 for Pr(wet), 4 for maximizing]
or, do this problem:
Consider a 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board. At each step, a marker hops from
its current cell to an up/down/left/right adjacent cell, choosing with
equal probability among its available options.
It cannot stay in the same cell during a hop.
i) Formulate a Markov chain for it.
ii) What do you think the steady-state solution will be?
iii) Find the steady-state solution. Is it what you thought it might be? Explain.
iv) Imagine that the marker cannot hop back to the cell it just came from.
Describe any needed changes in the Markov model, but you do not have to
formulate the matrix.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4.52: the taxi-driver, city with 2 zones.
It's possible to do this using a 2-state or a 4-state chain;
I recommend the 2-state.
First, find the proportion of trips that start in zone A.
Then, find the expected profit per trip starting in zone A.
Then, the expected profit per trip starting in zone B.
Then, combine them for the overall expected profit per trip.

Hint: one of the intermediate values you might get in this problem
is 0.4285714
[4 for matrix, 4 for pi vector, 4 for average cost]
or, do this problem:
Suppose an insurance company finds that their cost due to claims for each day
depends on the weather that day, and the weather the day before (because
the weather turning bad catches some people by surprise).
Pretend the weather each day is either Good, Fair, or bad. Also pretend that
only today is useful in predicting tomorrrow, and that the transition matrix is:
G F B
G .6 .3 .1
F .2 .6 .2
B .2 .3 .5
Also, here are the costs for each type of transition, in millions of dollars:
G F B
G 1 2 8
F 3 4 6
B 4 5 5
What is the long-run average cost per day?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
An inventory problem.
Suppose we receive a shipment of 3 items every day.
Our daily demand has a Uniform distribution on 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,
with no changes in behavior according to day-of-the-week.
Our warehouse only has room for 10 items during the
overnight period. Here is the timeline for events:
Midnight: take inventory; this is the DTMC state variable
6am: receive shipment of 3 items.
8am-9pm: demand occurs. If we run out of inventory, orders are lost
(as opposed to being backordered)
10pm: discard excess inventory that won't fit in the warehouse.
Midnight: take inventory again, etc.
Questions:
(a) Formulate the transition matrix. Hint: the value in the upper-
left corner is 0.625
(b) What is the probability we end up with nothing in the warehouse
overnight? Hint: it's around 0.3
(c) If it costs $10 per item in the warehouse overnight, what is
our average inventory cost per night? Hint: it's around $28 or $29

The following part is for grad students, though of course undergrads should
contemplate it. The calculations are somewhat intricate.
(d) What is the average number of items discarded per night
due to warehouse limitations?
Also, for everyone to contemplate but not solve unless you really want to:
(e) What fraction of our customers find us out of stock?

For the highway repair problem discussed in class, suppose you follow
the policy beta=
E M C N
G [ 0 0 .4 .6 ]
F [ 0 0 1 0 ]
B [ .1 .2 .7 0 ]
Define X0 to be the status in the year 2007, and X1 to be the status
in the year 2008. What is Pr(X1 = G | X0 = B)?
(I might have said Poor instead of Bad; they mean the same thing)

Consider the Ehrenfest urn model, where a fixed number (n) of total
molecules are put in two chambers connected by a very narrow passage,
such that only one molecule at a time can move from one to the other.
At each step, one of the molecules (regardless of location) is
randomly selected and it moves to the other chamber.
let X_t be the # of molecules in chamber 1 at step t.
a) Write the transition matrix for this DTMC, with n=4.
b) Find the steady-state distribution numerically (or symbolically if you wish)
c) Read page 240 (11th edition, Chapter 4.8, just before Example 4.36).

Optional: also see Problem 4.54, about how the mean changes with time.
It exponentially decays toward n/2.

Also optional: what would a 3-chamber version look like? Suppose each chamber
was connected to each other chamber.

Also optional: what would a 3-chamber version look like? Suppose the 3 chambers
were in a row, with the middle chamber connected to the 2 others, but no direct
connection between the leftmost and rightmost chamber.

Also optional: what if, instead of choosing a molecule at random regardless of
its position, we randomly choose 1 of the 2 chambers (with 50/50 prob.),
then choose a molecule from that and move it to the other chamber.
How does the transition matrix change, if at all?
[4 pts]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional: No-Backtracking 2D random walk
Simulate (using RAND() or RANDBETWEEN() or equivalent) a 2-dimensional random walk
that will not step back to the place it just came from (though it might return to
a place it's already visited, just not on the most recent step).
Suppose it can only step in the 4 main directions: North, South, East, West.
Ask some good questions about how it behaves, and answer them.
If you need help generating good questions, ask me.
How do things change if the steps can be N,S,E,W,NE,SE,NW,SW?

This problem is inspired by a question from
"Finite Markov Chains and Algorithmic Applications"
by Olle Haggstrom.

Consider a simple set of web pages:
A links to B and C
B links to A and D
C links to A
D links to A, B, and C
a) Write down the DTMC matrix for a random web surfer who picks
an outbound link with equal probability from all outbound links
on the current page.

b) Now suppose that in addition to following links, the surfer
might randomly jump to any page on this little web (including
the current page) by doing a search. This happens with probability
0.15. Can you still describe this situation with a Markov Chain?
Explain. If so, what does the new transition matrix look like?

c) Now ignore the modification in part (b) and consider the model
from part (a) again. Suppose that the random surfer hits the "back"
button on the browser with probability 0.05.
Can you still describe this situation with a Markov Chain? Explain.
If so, what does the new transition matrix look like?

This problem is inspired by a question from
"Finite Markov Chains and Algorithmic Applications"
by Olle Haggstrom.

Consider a DTMC whose states are labelled "-1", "0", and "+1", and
whose transition matrix is:
to: -1 0 +1
from -1: [ 0 1 0 ]
from 0: [ 0 0 1 ]
from +1: [ 1 0 0 ]

a) Suppose you generate data from this DTMC for 10 steps, starting
with -1. What would that data look like?
X_0 = -1
X_1 = ?
X_2 = ?
etc.

b) Let f(x) = x^2, and let Y_n = f(X_n); that is, Y_n is a function
of the data from the original DTMC. Generate data for the first 10
steps of Y_n:
Y_0 = (-1)^2 = +1
Y_1 = ?
Y_2 = ?
etc.

c) Is Y_n a Markov Chain? Explain. If so, give the transition matrix.

[4 pts]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
optional, for advanced pondering:
We've talked about Markov processes with 1 day of history (the usual kind),
and with 2 days of history, etc.
What would it mean to have a non-integer number of days of history?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
for grad students (though undergrads should also read these and contemplate):
Choose one of these four problems. Each is worth 16 total points.
Branching Process (stochastic version of exponential growth or decay)
a) Simulate a branching process with Pr(lives and has 1 offspring)=p, Pr(dies)=q.
You might like to use the BINOM.INV(trials,probability_s,alpha) function in Excel
to simulate a random Binomial, like this: BINOM.INV(#individuals,p,rand())
b) Make a large transition matrix for the same model (that will update live
if you change p and q). Start with 1 individual, and take many vector*matrix steps.
You might want to use the BINOMDIST function in Excel.
Come up with some interesting questions to ask, and answer them. If you want help
coming up with questions, email me.
c) repeat (a) and (b) for a branching process with no deaths:
Pr(lives and has 1 offspring)=p, Pr(lives but no offspring this time)=q.
d) (optional) can you change the model so it has a carrying capacity, and
growth slows down as comes nearer to that capacity? And if the population
is above the carrying capacity, it will be pulled downward toward the carrying capacity?


Problem 4.36: A Hidden Markov Model
Do the problem as specified in the book. Then, do the following
extension:

Prof. Ross has generated data on Y using
P=[.04 .96; .96 .04], and p0 = .02, p1 = .97
and put it on the web:
http://people.emich.edu/aross15/math419/4_36data.txt

Take this Y data and show that
Pr{Y_{n}=1 | Y_{n-1}=1} is different than
Pr{Y_{n}=1 | Y_{n-1}=1 and Y_{n-2}=1}; and
that's different than using 3 steps of history, etc.
This shows that the Yn values are not a Markov chain.

Three Independent Machines:
Consider a system with three independent machines.
Each one has a probability "f" of failing on any particular day
that it's working, and then once it's broken it has a
probability "r" of being repaired on any particular day.
a) Formulate a DTMC that describes this system of 3 machines.
Your formulation could have 4 states or 8 states; I recommend 8
states, because it's easier to figure out the transition probabilities.
b) Guess a symbolic steady-state distribution and check that it is true.

Gambler's Ruin with Ties
Let's modify Gambler's Ruin to allow a coin-flip to result in a tie.
Now, Pr{lose once}=a, Pr{tie}=b, Pr{win once}=c, with a+b+c=1.
a) Write down a new system of linear equations that the P_i
values must satisfy.

b) Guess a new formula to solve the new set of linear equations.
Recall that the solution to the linear equations without ties was
P_i = (1-gamma^i)/(1-gamma^N), where gamma=q/p
(I may have used the name alpha in class instead of gamma; whatever.)
Hint: does it work to just change the definition of gamma?

You may ignore the case where we might divide by zero.
Show that your guess indeed solves the system of linear equations.

c) What is the new system of equations for M_i ?
