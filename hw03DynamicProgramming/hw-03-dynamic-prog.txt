Dynamic Programming homework

Your homework should be typed in Word or something similar, with
appropriate spreadsheet segments copied and pasted in.  

On each problem's part (a), do it without considering any software like
Excel, Matlab, R, etc.

1.  Recall the shortest-path problem we did in class.  Find a way to
do it in Excel or some other software package (your choice).

2.  Consider the same network that we used for the shortest-path problem,
but now instead of minimizing the total path length, we want to minimize
the longest single road segment we use (for example, our car is unreliable
and we don't want to go on long roads where we'd be far from help if it
breaks down).
a) Define your value function and write a recursion for it, and define your
 boundary values.
b) Solve either by hand or using software.  Report the optimal value and path.
c) Compare the path to the original shortest-path problem. If it is the same,
describe what kind of changes would have to happen for this new problem
to give a different optimal path than the old problem?

3.  Again consider the same network, but now interpret each road cost (divided
by 100) as the probability of car failure on that road.  What route gives the
highest overall probability of success?  For a path to succeed, you need to
have a success on each road on that path.  The probability of this is _not_ 
just the sum of the success probabilities.
a) Define your value function and write a recursion for it, and define your
 boundary values.
b) Solve either by hand or using software.  Report the optimal value and path.
c) Compare this path to the original shortest-path problem. If it is the same,
describe what kind of changes would have to happen for this new problem
to give a different optimal path than the old problem?


4.  Again consider the same network.  Now we're back to the original shortest-
path problem.  but change the cost on the road from P to B to be 1 billion (10^9)
(yikes!).  And, decisions to go up succeed with probability 80%; 
decisions to go down succeed with probability 90% (this may be
backwards from what we said in class; use the values here).  If a decision
doesn't succeed, that means you end up going the opposite way that you chose.
Minimize the total expected path cost.
a) Define your value function and write a recursion for it, and define your
 boundary values.
b) Solve either by hand or using software.  Report the optimal value and path.
c) Compare to the original shortest-path problem. If it is the same,
describe what kind of changes would have to happen for this new problem
to give a different optimal path than the old problem?

5.  Your professor will send you a link to some academic papers that use
dynamic programming.  Skim through them. Pick one to read in depth.
Write down any questions that occur to you (things you don't understand,
etc.)
