homework questions

Question 50:
Let's investigate the idea of "overdifferencing". This is an experimental question.
i) Set up a white noise process, plus a constant value of 3.
ii) Take a running cumulative sum of part (i)
iii) Take a running cumulative sum of part (ii)
iv) Now suppose that part (iii) was the original data set. It's clearly not stationary, right? So take differences.
Is the result stationary?
v) If the result of part (iv) wasn't stationary, take differences again. Is the result stationary?
If so, compute the StdDev of the data.
vi) Take differences again. Is it stationary? If so, compute the StdDev. 
vii) Look at the results of part (v) and (vi). Write a sentence or two about "overdifferencing".
viii) [optional] for advanced thought: In some cases it's possible that we need to take a difference not once or twice or 3 times, but 2.5 or 1.something times.
These are called "fractionally integrated" processes. Hmm. Ponder.

```{r}
# i) Set up a white noise process, plus a constant value of 3.
white_noise = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1) + 3
# ii) Take a running cumulative sum of part (i)
cum_sum_of_w_n = cumsum(white_noise)
# iii) Take a running cumulative sum of part (ii)
cum_sum_of_cum_of_w_n = cumsum(cum_sum_of_w_n)
# results
#sprintf("%5.2f", white_noise) # uncomment if you'd like to see them.
#sprintf("%5.2f", cum_sum_of_w_n)
#sprintf("%5.2f", cum_sum_of_cum_of_w_n)
plot(white_noise, xlab='time ticks', type = "o", col = "red")
```


```{r}
# iv) Now suppose that part (iii) was the original data set. It's clearly not stationary, right? So take differences.
# Is the result stationary?
faux_orig_data = cum_sum_of_cum_of_w_n
differences = diff(faux_orig_data, lag = 1, differences = 1)
#sprintf("part (iv), differences: ") # uncomment if you'd like to see them.
#sprintf("%5.2f", differences)

iv) Now suppose that part (iii) was the original data set. It's clearly not stationary, right? So take differences.
Is the result stationary?

Answer:
This process is not stationary.  It has an increasing trend that looks quite convincingly linear.

```{r}
# v) If the result of part (iv) wasn't stationary, take differences again. Is the result stationary?
# If so, compute the StdDev of the data.
diff_of_diff = diff(faux_orig_data, lag = 1, differences = 2) # note differences = 2 for second difference
#sprintf("part (v), differences of differences: ") # uncomment if you'd like to see them.
#sprintf("%5.2f", diff_of_diff)
stdev = sd(diff_of_diff)
sprintf("stdev of the diff of diffs: %.2f", stdev)
plot(diff_of_diff, xlab='time ticks', type = "o", col = "red")
```

v) If the result of part (iv) wasn't stationary, take differences again. Is the result stationary?
If so, compute the StdDev of the data.

Answer:
Yes, the result of the differences of the differences looks stationary.
In one run of the notebook I got a standard deviation of .94
Example output: [1] "stdev of the diff of diffs: 0.94"
That stdev of .94 is very close to the rnorm stdev of 1.
There were 100 iterations for that rnorm so I would say that it is close enough to 1.

```{r}
# vi) Take differences again. Is it stationary? If so, compute the StdDev. 
third_differences = diff(faux_orig_data, lag = 1, differences = 3) # note differences = 2 for third difference
#sprintf("part (v),third differences: ") # uncomment if you'd like to see them.
#sprintf("%5.2f", third_differences)
stdev = sd(third_differences)
sprintf("stdev of the third differences: %.2f", stdev)
plot(third_differences, xlab='time ticks', type = "o", col = "red")
```
--
vii) Look at the results of part (v) and (vi). Write a sentence or two about "overdifferencing".

Answer:
Once you have taken the differences to arrive at 'white noise', then more differencing will only result in more white noise.  We took differences to recover the original signal.  We arrived at the original signal when we saw that its signal was white noise.  However, more differencing only generated plots with more white noise. This suggests that when repeatedly taking differences, one can stop when one arrives at a signal looking like white noise.
